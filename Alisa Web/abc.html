<h1>Dachshund</h1>
<h2>Here is a quick introduction of Duchshund:</h2>
<p>D<strong>achshund</strong>, also known as the <strong>wiener dog</strong>, <strong>badger dog</strong>, and <strong>sausage dog</strong>, is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. The dog may be smooth-haired, wire-haired, or long-haired, and comes in a variety of colors.</p>
<p>The standard-sized dachshund was developed to scent,chase, and flush out badgers and other burrow-dwelling animals. The miniature dachshund was bred to hunt small animals such as rabbits.</p>
<p>According to the American Kennel Club, the dachshund was ranked 12th in popularity among dog breeds in the United States in 2018.</p>
<p>A typical dachshund is long-bodied and muscular with short stubby legs. Its front paws are disproportionately large, being paddle-shaped and particularly suitable for digging. Its skin is loose enough not to tear while tunneling in tight burrows to chase prey. The dachshund has a deep chest which provides plenty of space for heart development and lung capacity. Its snout is long.</p>
